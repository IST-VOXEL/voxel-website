The IST‑PhysFront’25 symposium (1st edition), held on 10 September 2025 at Técnico Innovation Center, is an annual event by the Department of Physics at IST showcasing cutting‑edge research. In the Research Highlight session, Marta Fajardo presented a talk titled “When Light Becomes Stronger Than Matter”, exploring the frontier of intense laser–matter interactions and advanced X‑ray imaging.

As part of her presentation, Marta introduced the NanoXcan project, highlighting its mission to develop compact, high-resolution X-ray imaging tools capable of probing matter at extreme conditions — bridging fundamental plasma physics, ultrafast lasers, and novel diagnostic techniques.

Thanks to the organizers!
