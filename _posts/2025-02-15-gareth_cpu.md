As part of the FCT RNCA call for computing time, Gareth Williams was awarded 2 million CPU hours to investigate materials in extreme conditions using Deucalion. This computational time will support his work carried out under his FCT CEEC grant, and model dense quantum plasmas created at VOXEL, and solid density photo ionised plasmas created by X-ray free electron lases.
