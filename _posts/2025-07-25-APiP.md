PhD student Lucas Ansia represented VOXEL at the 22nd International Conference on Atomic Processes in Plasmas (APiP 2025), held July 21–25 at Tokyo Metropolitan University in Hachioji, Tokyo.

At the conference, Lucas delivered an oral presentation titled “Shake‑off in XFEL‑Heated Solid‑Density Plasma”, detailing his latest research on shake-off processes in XFEL-driven plasmas. His talk highlighted that including shake-off is essential for accurately interpreting spectral emission from photoionized solid-density plasmas—showing how secondary electron ejection significantly shapes observed spectra.

Lucas’s work is based on recent measurements demonstrating that shake-off of L-shell electrons in solid-density targets persists up to ~10 eV, affecting spectral satellite features that cannot be explained by collisional or Auger processes alone.

Thanks to the organizing team for a great week of atomic physics!
