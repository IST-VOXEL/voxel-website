Last week, part of the GoLP team traveled to Vilnius, Lithuania, for the 51st European Physical Society Conference on Plasma Physics.

From the VOXEL team, researcher Gareth Williams and PhD student Lucas Ansia attended the event.

Gareth Williams presented a poster titled "XUV Imaging of Electron Heating and Density Changes in Femtosecond Laser Heating of Solid Ti", showcasing diagnostics of ultrafast laser-matter interaction at solid densities.

Lucas Ansia gave an oral contribution, presenting his work on fast electron thermalization in solid-density iron plasmas.

Thanks to the organizing committee for a fantastic week of science and discussion!
