## VUV to X-rays Experiments with Light

The goal of the **VOXEL team** is to advance understanding of laser-plasma interactions, unlocking new frontiers in high-energy-density physics and warm dense matter (WDM) research.

### Our efforts focus on:

- Cutting-edge ultrafast plasma diagnostics  using ultrashort pulses to untangle short-timescale plasma dynamics  
- Providing benchmark data on plasma atomic physics  supporting modeling for fusion, astrophysics, and more  
- Developing advanced computational methods for collisional-radiative models. 
- Pioneering innovative X-ray imaging techniques  with coherent and incoherent light  
- Harnessing structured laser-pulse control  to precisely manipulate plasma evolution  
- Advancing secondary source development  high harmonic generation in gases/solids, and X-rays from lasersolid interactions
