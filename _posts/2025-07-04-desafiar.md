As part of the 13th “Desafiar os Limites em Ciência e Tecnologia” event, organized by the Department of Physics at Instituto Superior Técnico, high school students visited the VOXEL lab. This initiative introduces students to Technological Physics Engineering through engaging talks and lab tours.

During their visit, students learned about our research on laser-plasma interactions, X-ray imaging, and many more, guided by Prof. Marta Fajardo (team leader) and Robert Neumann (PhD student).

We hope this visit inspired them towards future careers in science!

Congrats, Lucas!
