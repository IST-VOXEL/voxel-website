Members of GoLP from the VOXEL team (Lucas Ansia, Gareth Williams and Marta Fajardo) participated in the Radiative Properties of Warm Dense Matter (RPHDM 2024) conference in Paris, which focused on theoretical and experimental advancements in dense plasmas. Key topics included opacity calculations and novel experiments conducted at world-class facilities. Gareth Williams presented experimental results on the role of the shake-off process in the warm dense matter regime, while Lucas Ansia discussed modeling XFEL-solid interactions, highlighting the importance of accounting for non-thermal electron distributions.
